# Welcome to XDU-Educational-UAV üöÅ

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of XDU-Educational-UAV. Our repositories are dedicated to the development and sharing of educational UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) projects. Below you will find a list of our current projects along with a brief description of each.

## Repositories

### [Drone_Master_PID](https://github.com/XDU-Educational-UAV/Drone_Master_PID) üéÆ
**Language**: C  
This repository contains the main control terminal for our educational UAV, implemented with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control approach. It is designed for those who are interested in traditional control systems in UAVs.

### [Drone_APP](https://github.com/XDU-Educational-UAV/Drone_APP) üì±
**Language**: Java  
This is the Android application repository for controlling and monitoring our educational UAVs. This app is perfect for on-the-go adjustments and real-time data monitoring.

### [Drone_Master_ADRC](https://github.com/XDU-Educational-UAV/Drone_Master_ADRC) üïπ
**Language**: C  
The main control terminal for the educational UAV, this time implemented with an Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) strategy. This is suited for those exploring advanced control techniques in UAVs.

### [Drone_Simulation](https://github.com/XDU-Educational-UAV/Drone_Simulation) üíª
**Language**: MATLAB  
In this repository, you can find the Matlab simulations for our educational UAV, specifically focusing on the PID version. It's ideal for those who want to test and simulate control strategies before actual deployment.
